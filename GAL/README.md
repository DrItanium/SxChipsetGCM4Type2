This folder contains the gal equations used to power the type2.01 board rev2.

I have tested these files with galette, a wonderful reimplementation of GALasm
that is easy to install via cargo. You need five 16V8 gal chips (ATF16V8C),
four of them will use the TransparentEightToTwo.pld. The last one uses Glue960.pld.
